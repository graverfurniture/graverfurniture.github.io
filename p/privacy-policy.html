    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>GF Task</strong> (“the App”). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes what information we may collect, how we use it, and how you can exercise your rights regarding your personal information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>GF Task is designed to function primarily offline and collects minimal user information. Depending on your Android version, the app may request access to external storage for reading files related to user operations.</p>
    <p>We may also collect limited technical and anonymous data, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system version (non-personal information)</li>
      <li>Error logs or crash reports (to improve app stability)</li>
      <li>Anonymous usage data (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personally identifiable information (such as names, photos, or contact details) is collected or stored by GF Task.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Android Permission Used</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following Android permission for proper operation:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
    android:maxSdkVersion="32" /&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Permission Explanation:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong> — This permission allows the app to read files stored on your device (for example, to import data or display user-selected files). It is limited to Android 13 (API level 32) and below, following Google Play’s latest privacy requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The permission is used solely for app functionality and never for collecting, sharing, or selling user data. GF Task does not access any private or personal files without user interaction.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>Information collected by the App (if any) may be used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure smooth performance and functionality.</li>
      <li>Diagnose and fix bugs or crashes.</li>
      <li>Improve the overall user experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>GF Task does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade any data to third parties.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We store minimal data and take reasonable technical measures to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, please note that no electronic system or method of transmission is completely secure.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>GF Task does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs at this time. If such services are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly to reflect their data handling practices.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in technology, legal requirements, or app features. The updated version will always include the latest revision date at the top of this page.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>If you wish to know what data (if any) the app has stored or you want it deleted, please contact us by email. We will respond as soon as possible in compliance with applicable privacy laws.</p>
